\begin{abstract}
    Knowledge-free, randomized exploration techniques in heuristic search algorithms have proved to be very effective. Noting that trusting too fully the evaluation function in suboptimal search can land the search into large plateaus or otherwise away from simpler paths to the goal state, the hope is that by devoting some energy to exploring the state space and not just marching forward via the evaluation function, a solution might be yielded faster. 
    
    Anytime Heuristic Search combines the benefits of fast suboptimal search with optimal search algorithms. It employs an inadmissible heuristic to arrive at solutions quickly, while the admissible heuristic is used to prune the open list and slowly converge on the optimal solution; in this way it gets the best of both worlds--the optimal solution in the end, but fast suboptimal solutions in the meantime. 
    
    In this study, I seek to examine the benefits of employing knowledge-free, randomized exploration in an anytime context to see if exploration can help anytime search algorithms converge on the optimal solution faster, use fewer resources, or both. For this, I will use Anytime Weight A$^*$ as the baseline and implement two exploration techniques giving two Exploration Anytime Algorithms: \eawa and \ebawa. Several experiments using the sliding tile puzzle are used to compare the three algorithms. These experiments, while preliminary, convincingly demonstrate that using knowledge-free randomized exploration can be effective in anytime search algorithms and more investigation into the combination of randomized exploration and anytime search is needed.
