\section{Evaluation}
In order to evaluate the usefulness of exploration in AWA$^*$ a number of experiments were conducted on 2 problem domains--the unit-cost and the inverse-cost sliding tile puzzles. In each domain, multiple weights and epsilon values will be used to parameterize the three algorithms. For the weights, 1.3, 2, and 5, will be used in order to see how weighing the heuristic more or less impacts the search. For $\epsilon-$AWA$^*$ and $\alpha \beta-$AWA$^*$, 0.1 and 0.3 will be used as the $\epsilon$ value in order to see how more or less random exploration impacts the search.
