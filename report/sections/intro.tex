\section{Introduction}

Evaluation Metrics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Total Stored nodes \cite{hansen2007anytime}
    \item Total Expanded nodes \cite{hansen2007anytime}
    \item Solution quality at fixed CPU intervals \cite{thayer2012better}
    \item Average time between solutions \cite{thayer2012better}
    \item Average number of solutions found before optimal solution was found
    \item Average time taken to find optimal solution
    \item Lower bound on optimal solution at fixed CPU intervals
\end{enumerate}


Parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Weights: 1.3, 1.5, 2 \cite{hansen2007anytime} (1.3 performed best, so maybe just do that?)
    \item Epsilon: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 \cite{valenzano2014comparison}
    \item Unit cost and inverse cost
\end{enumerate}
