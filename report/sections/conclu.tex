\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
While the results above are promising, the experimentation done was very limited in its scope and left a lot to be desired. 

For starters, very few domains were investigated. Just investigating the tile puzzle makes it difficult to make any general statements about these results. 

The investigation into $\alpha \beta$-AWA$^*$ was incomplete because the beta distribution was fixed for all experiments. Discovering any merits or shortcomings of $\alpha \beta$-AWA$^*$ would require a whole set of experiments examining different distributions across various domains. Based on these early results I'd say $\alpha \beta$-AWA$^*$ looks interesting, but the fact it was not convincingly better than random sampling means more experimentation needs to be done. 

There are many other exploration techniques that could be evaluated in an anytime context. Type-Based exploration, which appears to perform very well in many domains would be an obvious starting point. 

Ultimately, I think this was a useful pilot study into using randomized exploration in an anytime search algorithm, but still more investigation is required before anything definitive is said.
